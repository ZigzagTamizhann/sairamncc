    <h2>About NCC</h2>
    <p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces with its headquarters in
      New Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis as a Tri-Services
      Organisation, comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, engaged in developing the youth of the
      country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The soldier youth foundation in India is a voluntary
      organisation which recruits cadets from high schools, higher secondary, colleges and universities all over
      India. The cadets are given basic military training in small arms and drill. The officers and cadets have no
      liability for active military service once they complete their course. The emblem of the NCC consists of 3
      colours; red, dark blue and light blue. These colours represent the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air
      Force respectively. The 17 lotuses indicate the 17 directorates. NCC strives to be and is one of the
      greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country
      and moulding them into united and disciplined citizens of the nation. With its motto “UNITY AND
      DISCIPLINE ”.</p>
